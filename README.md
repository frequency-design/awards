TIE-Awards-Example

1) What is wrong with the component you chose?
   A: There is nothing wrong with the awards component on the homepage, but I thought I would try and make it interactive.

3) How will you improve it?
   A: I will make each image load with a blur effect and create an animated mouse hover state.
   
5) Given more time what would you further improve?
   A: It would have contained all the correct award images and been more responsive.
